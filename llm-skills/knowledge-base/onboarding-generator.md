# Goal

Produce a logically ordered onboarding path from the corpus for a specific audience, each
step grounded in cited chunks. This skill sequences and grounds existing content; it does
not invent procedures.

# Inputs

```yaml
index: { topics: [...] }
chunks: [ { id, text, source } ]
options:
  audience: new-engineer
  language: ko
```

# Output

```yaml
onboarding:
  - step: <n>
    title: <step title>
    content: <what to do/know, grounded in chunks>
    source_refs: [K-0001, ...]
    gap: <"source needed" if a logical step lacks coverage, else omitted>
```

# Workflow

## Step 1 — Sequence topics
Order topics into a sensible learning progression for the audience (setup → basics →
workflows → policies).

## Step 2 — Ground each step
Write each step from supporting chunks and cite them.

## Step 3 — Mark gaps
Where a logical step has no corpus support, add `gap: "source needed"` rather than inventing.

## Step 4 — Return
Return `onboarding`. Stop.

# Rules

- Every step's content is grounded in cited chunks; never fabricate procedures.
- Mark missing steps as gaps so coverage is transparent.
- Order for the audience; keep steps actionable.
- Do not duplicate the full FAQ; onboarding is a guided path, not a Q&A list.

# Examples

Input:

```yaml
index: { topics: [ { name: 환경설정, chunk_ids: [K-0003] }, { name: 배포, chunk_ids: [K-0001] } ] }
chunks: [ { id: K-0003, text: "사내 VPN을 먼저 설치한다.", source: handbook.pdf }, { id: K-0001, text: "배포는 매주 화요일.", source: handbook.pdf } ]
options: { audience: new-engineer, language: ko }
```

Output:

```yaml
onboarding:
  - { step: 1, title: "환경 설정", content: "사내 VPN을 먼저 설치합니다.", source_refs: [K-0003] }
  - { step: 2, title: "배포 주기 이해", content: "배포는 매주 화요일 진행됩니다.", source_refs: [K-0001] }
```
