# Goal

Confirm the playlist plays well and respects hard constraints before it is presented,
returning a deterministic pass/fail verdict with fixes. This validates the playlist; it does
not reorder it.

# Scope

- Duration (total within a reasonable band of the target)
- Energy arc (no jarring energy/BPM jumps between adjacent tracks)
- Explicit filter (no explicit track when disallowed)
- Uniqueness (no duplicate track/artist over-repetition)

Out of scope: subjective taste, exact beatmatching.

# Checks

1. `total_duration` is within ~±15% of `duration_target` (when set).
2. Adjacent tracks have no jarring energy/BPM discontinuity given the intended arc.
3. No explicit track appears when `hard_filters.explicit` is false.
4. No duplicate tracks; artist repetition is reasonable.

# Pass-Fail Criteria

- **pass**: duration on target, arc coherent, explicit filter honored, no duplicates.
- **fail**: duration far off, jarring transitions, an explicit track when disallowed, or
  duplicates.

# Output Schema

```yaml
flow_report:
  result: pass | fail
  issues:
    - { position: <order or "-">, area: duration | arc | explicit | duplicate, detail: <what>, fix: <suggestion> }
  stats: { tracks: <n>, total_duration: <sum>, issues: <n> }
```

# Rules

- Report issues and fixes only; never reorder or replace tracks (the sequencer does that).
- Deterministic verdict: any explicit-violation or duplicate forces `fail`; large duration
  miss or jarring jump forces `fail`.
- Judge against the profile's target/arc, not assumptions.
- Do not assess subjective quality; only the checkable properties.

# Examples

Input:

```yaml
music_profile: { hard_filters: { explicit: false, duration_target: "90분" } }
sequenced_playlist: { total_duration: "42분", tracks: [ { order: 1, title: "X", explicit: true } ] }
annotated_playlist: { tracks: [ { order: 1, title: "X" } ] }
```

Output:

```yaml
flow_report:
  result: fail
  issues:
    - { position: 1, area: explicit, detail: "explicit 트랙이 explicit:false 조건 위반", fix: "클린 버전 또는 대체곡" }
    - { position: "-", area: duration, detail: "42분 << 목표 90분", fix: "트랙 추가로 목표 근접" }
  stats: { tracks: 1, total_duration: "42분", issues: 2 }
```
